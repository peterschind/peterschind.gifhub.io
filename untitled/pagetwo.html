<body>Mac Miller aka Larry Fisherman, ahs been my favorite artist for a while. He grow up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He bagan rapping while still in high school. My older brother would show me his songs on youtube and I immediately became a fan. Mac released almost ten albums and many more mixtapes by the age of 26. Unfortunately, Mac Miller had substance abuse problems, and passed away this month. His music continues to spread happiness and postivity wherever it is played.
